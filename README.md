Hey there! I'm Nidhish Suvarna, a passionate Data Science beginner with a love for coding and problem-solving.

🎓 I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Master of Business Administration (MBA) in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence from Chandigarh University. I hold a Bachelor of Computer Application (BCA) degree from Amity University, Mumbai. My educational background has equipped me with a strong foundation in Python, Machine Learning, SQL, NLP, and many other programming languages related to Data Science, which I love to apply in creative and innovative ways.

🚀 Outside of my professional life, you can find me diving into exciting various projects. I'm particularly enthusiastic about Data Visualisation technologies along with coding in Python and SQL and enjoy contributing to open source projects that make a positive impact.

🌱 When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I enjoy Cooking, Exploring some destinations and Yoga for better mental health. I believe in continuous learning and strive to keep myself updated with the latest advancements in the tech world.

📫 Feel free to connect with me here on GitHub, where I'm always excited to collaborate, learn, and share ideas. Let's build something awesome together!
